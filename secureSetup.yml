#!! THIS SCRIPT WAS BUILT FOR UBUNTU 19.04, IT MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY ON OTHER UNIX VARIANTS!!

# This script will configure a freshly installed server to a baselined "secured" state:
  #Update and install packages
  #Create unprivileged user account
  #Upload SSH keys on your Ansible Server
  #Configure firewall rules
  #Disallow password authentication for SSH
  #Disable root from SSH
